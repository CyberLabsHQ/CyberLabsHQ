# My portfolio, blog and side projects
I am a software engineer with a passion for learning and teaching. I love to share my knowledge with others and help them grow. I am a big fan of open source and I try to contribute to open source projects as much as I can. I am also a big fan of automation and I try to automate everything I can.
